# PolynomialFunctionSolver
## Tutorial
### Prerequisites
In order to download the program make sure you have python3.10 or higher installed on your computer. 
### Installation
In order to install the file, run `git clone https://BenRaz123/PolynomialFunctionSolver.git`. Once the command is done running, run `cd PolynomialFunctionSolver` and run `ls`. If you see `main.py`, then congratulations, everything went well. If not, try again.
#### Raycast
There is a raycast specific dependency that can be installed with `pip install pyperclip`. Once you have done that, copy `raycast.py` into whatever folder Raycast uses for script commands. Raycast will now accept inputs in comma-seperated form.

### How-To
Although the app is self-explanatory, some still need a written tutorial. 

When you run the app, the program will ask you to input a leading coefficient. Enter a number with your keyboard and press 'enter'. Repeat this as often as you like. Once you finish, write 'n' and press enter. 

Employ a similar process for the inputs.

After this is done, the algorithm will output a list of mapped value. Done!
