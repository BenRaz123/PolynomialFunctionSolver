# PolynomialFunctionSolver - Rust Branch
## What is this?
This branch is an attempt to create an executable with Rust. Once it has reached feauture parity with `master` it will be offered as an alternative to `main.py` but will not replace `raycast.py` because Raycast does not support Rust scripts.
## Tutorial
In addition to the tutorial at master, just run `cargo build -r` as well as copying `target/release/polysolver` to `usr/bin`.
